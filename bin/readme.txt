By default, bedtools genomecov will compute a histogram of coverage for the genome file provided. The default output format is as follows:

    chromosome (or entire genome)
    depth of coverage from features in input file
    number of bases on chromosome (or genome) with depth equal to column 2.
    size of chromosome (or entire genome) in base pairs
    fraction of bases on chromosome (or entire genome) with depth equal to column 2.
